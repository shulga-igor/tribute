Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites. </p>


                <h3>Third parties:</h3>
                <p>To enable our service to you in the form of storing data, communicating with you and for other reasons to process your claim we will use third party contractors to perform certain functions, these companies are: </p>
                
                
                <ul>
                  <li>SendGrid</li>
                  <li>Mailchimp</li>

                <h3>Where We Store Your Personal Data:</h3>
                <p>We will store or transfer your personal data within the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). The EEA consists of all EU member states, plus Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein. This means that your personal data will be fully protected under the Data Protection Legislation, GDPR, and/or to equivalent standards by law. 
                  We also store or transfer some or all of your personal data in countries that are not part of the EEA. These are known as “third countries” and may not have data protection laws that are as strong as those in the UK and/or the EEA. This means that we will take additional steps in order to ensure that your personal data is treated just as safely and securely as it would be within the UK and under the Data Protection Legislation. We ensure that any data which is stored outside of the EEA is  compliant with GDPR and that all data is protected as per GDPR/Data Protection guidance. We are satisfied that our current checks ensure your data is protected. 
                  </p>


        
                  
                  <h3>Data Security:</h3>
                  <p>We are committed to ensure that your personal data is protected at all times. The data we hold is held on securely encrypted servers and is protected against loss or misuse. We use the advice of the ICO and work within their regulations as well as that of the EU GDPR regulations which came into effect on 25th May 2018. </p>

                  <p>If you chose to send us information via email, we cannot guarantee the security of this information. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to ensure it is dealt with in accordance with this Privacy Notice. </p>

                  <h3>How Can I Access My Personal Data? </h3>

                  <p>If you want to know what personal data we have about you, you can ask us for details of that personal data and for a copy of it (where any such personal data is held). This is known as a “subject access request”. 
                    All subject access requests should be made in writing and sent to the email or postal addresses shown in the How To Contact Us section. 
                    There is not normally any charge for a subject access request. If your request is ‘manifestly unfounded or excessive’ (for example, if you make repetitive requests) a fee may be charged to cover our administrative costs in responding. 
                    We will respond to your subject access request within one month of receiving it. Normally, we aim to provide a complete response, including a copy of your personal data within that time. In some cases, however, particularly if your request is more complex, more time may be required up to a maximum of three months from the date we receive your request. You will be kept fully informed of our progress. 
                    </p>
